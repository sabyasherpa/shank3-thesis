# shank3-thesis
This repository contains R scripts used to analyze RNA-seq data from SHANK3 heterozygous knockout (HT) mice (GSE201621). The analysis includes differential gene expression (DESeq2), gene ontology enrichment (clusterProfiler), and pathway overlay using human orthologs.

The goal is to investigate region-specific transcriptional effects of SHANK3 haploinsufficiency in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, in the context of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS).

Main scripts:
- `DESeq2_pipeline.R`: differential expression workflow
- `GO_enrichment.R`: gene ontology analysis
- `Ortholog_mapping.R`: mapping mouse to human genes

This work supports a bachelor thesis at Maastricht University (2025).
